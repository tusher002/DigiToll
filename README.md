Team Members : Tusher Chandra Mondol, Hasib Iqbal, Saifuddin Mahmud (Assistant Professor, KUET)

A experimental approach of running a system 24 hours a day without interruption concerned with fully automated toll collection system using active RFID tags with privacy preserving mutual authentication system which is able to reduce human effort and time and most importantly traffic jam. In this system when a vehicle enters into the tollgate area system will electronically identify the vehicle, calculate the exact amount of toll, deduct toll. Every information of vehicles are saved in a centralized database controlled by the authority which is mapped with a prepaid smartcard cum license card. There is a recharge booth for recharging account if balance is insufficient.
